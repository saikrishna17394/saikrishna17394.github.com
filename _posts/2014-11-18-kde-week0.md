###Getting started with GCompris 
----------------------------------


Get the Gcompris code from KDE Git repository

	$ git clone git@github.com:bdoin/GCompris-qt.git

	$ cd GCompris-qt

Create a branch for your development
	
	$ git checkout -b exercise


- Start QtCreator and open the project file CmakeLists.txt at the root of the source code.

- Run CMake without any arguments.

Create a new activity named "my_new_activity"

	$ cd src/activities

	$ ./createit.sh 'my_new_activity'

- Compile GCompris again in QtCreator, and check 'my_new_activity' is present.

- You can search for code examples in other activities and check the [Qml getting started](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/gettingstartedqml.html). Modify the activity and run to check if it works.


- **If you add resources in you activity's resource directory you must run cmake again.**

[Jekyll][jekyll] is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. Here is a little quote from the official website:

> It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown][markdown] (or [Textile][textile]) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages][github-pages], which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
