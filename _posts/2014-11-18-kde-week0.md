####Getting started with GCompris 
___

Get the Gcompris code from KDE Git repository

	$ git clone git@github.com:bdoin/GCompris-qt.git

	$ cd GCompris-qt

Create a branch for your development
	
	$ git checkout -b exercise


- Start QtCreator and open the project file CmakeLists.txt at the root of the source code.

- Run CMake without any arguments.

Create a new activity named "my_new_activity"

	$ cd src/activities

	$ ./createit.sh 'my_new_activity'

- Compile GCompris again in QtCreator, and check 'my_new_activity' is present.

- You can search for code examples in other activities and check the [Qml getting started](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/gettingstartedqml.html). Modify the activity and run to check if it works.


- **If you add resources in your activity's resource directory you must run cmake again.**
